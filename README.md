 ðŸ‘¤ Human Detection using YOLOv8 + Webcam

This project uses a custom-trained [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) model to **detect humans in real-time** using your **laptop webcam**. Itâ€™s built with Python, OpenCV, and the Ultralytics YOLO library.

 ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Real-time human detection
- âœ… Runs directly from your laptop webcam
- âœ… YOLOv8 - fast, lightweight, accurate
- âœ… Easy to train and fine-tune on custom data
- âœ… GPU support for fast training and inference

## âš¡ Use GPU for Best Performance

> âœ… It is **strongly recommended** to use a **GPU** (via CUDA) for both training and real-time testing to achieve faster results.

If you're using a compatible NVIDIA GPU, ensure the following:

- Install CUDA and cuDNN
- Your environment has `torch` with GPU support:
  ```bash
  pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

## To check if YOLOv8 is using the GPU:

  import torch
  print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should return True
